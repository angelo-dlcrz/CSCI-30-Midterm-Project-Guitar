# Synthesized Guitar

This is a group project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class where users can play a guitar (a very limited one) using just their keyboard.

## How to Run

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository into your working machine.
2. Make sure that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your machine. It is recommended to use Python 3.
3. Run the command line. Change your working directory into the directory where you cloned this repository. Once there, enter the following command:

```console
$ py guitar.py
```
4. A Pygame window will open. You are now ready to play the guitar!

## How to Use

1. Use the keyboard to play the guitar. You may use the following keys:

```bash
keyboard = "q2we4r5ty7u8i9op-[=]"
```
2. This keyboard arrangement imitates a piano keyboard. "White keys" are on the qwerty row while "black keys" are on the 12345 row. Obviously, instead of a piano sound, what you get is a guitar sound. See the image below for reference.
